Creating a Dice for playing board games with friends!! 

I created this game with the intention to use it for playing board games or any other activity related to Dice numbers!!

This is a simple project that gathers all three technologies that I'm investing my time on: 

- Javascript: DOM Manipulation
- CSS: Style made with flexbox aiming for responsiviness.
- HTML: Semantic code.

Please, if you have any suggestions I'm all ears.
